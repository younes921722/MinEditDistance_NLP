**Paraphrase:** **Minimum Edit Distance Algorithm** This Python code implements the Minimum Edit Distance algorithm, also called Levenshtein Distance, from scratch. **Purpose** The algorithm calculates the minimum number of changes (adding, removing, or replacing characters) needed to turn one string into another. **Use Cases** The algorithm is useful in areas like spell checking, DNA sequencing, and computer linguistics. **Implementation** The code uses Python and dynamic programming to efficiently compute the edit distance between two strings without relying on other libraries. The main function, min_edit_distance, takes two strings as input and returns the minimum edit distance between them.
